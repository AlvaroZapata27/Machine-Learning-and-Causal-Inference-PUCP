# My-Paper-Replications
Here I will post my Reports and Notebooks from the course Machine Learning and Causal Inference which i took the 2022-1 semester in PUCP.

Folder : Good and Bad Controls\
This is a replication of the directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) from the paper "A Crash Course in Good and Bad Controls" by Cinelli, Forney and Pearl (2022). The purpose of this note is to provide practicing analysts a concise, simple,
and visual summary of these criteria through illustrative examples while providing Python code to that ilustrates each model concept in the original paper.
I provide 18 models that ilustrate the problem of "bad controls" when adding varables to a regression and wether it helps
getting estimates closer to the parameter of interest.

Note: if the DAGs are not visible you might try running it in Google Colab.\

Folder : Reports\
Here you will find the reports of the academic papers i read during the semester. The report is a small resume from work of important authors that cover themes such as High dimmensional data problems, inferencial causality, double Machine Learningand Causal Forest.

Future work will be upload.
